#Frontend Mentor Challenge

Deployed on Netlify: https://diegodestf-interactive-rating.netlify.app/

This challenge was very fun. I had to learn new things and review some others to apply them correctly.

The challenge only asked for the user to be able to submit a rating and to trigger the active states. However, I decided to add validation, meaning that you could only press submit if you had already selected a rating, thus stopping the submit button from being clicked.

Moreover, I added animations to transition between the two components using React Transition Groups to make the UX feel smoother.
